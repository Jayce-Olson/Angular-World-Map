# Info

This school project was my first exposure to Angular. It involves an SVG world map and works with the [World Bank API](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/api) to retrieve information for each country on hover.

A demo can be accessed [here](https://angular-world-map.web.app/)

Angular version 18.2.9.
